					<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>The project idea I had in mind was a simulation-based game which young children could play from ages 12 and above which would simulate trading and giving a raw and initial understanding of trading, buy and selling stocks. The project would be a game which trades on a small scale up to 10 dollars and would introduce kids, high schoolers to understand the importance of money management, investing and trading, utilising a trophy system where students who win and can compete with classmates and other schools can win awards.</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>I believe this project is incredibly interesting as kids, students growing up through high school are not shown trading and economic work. Once out of school and young adults’ financial habits and investment are all new expressions with little experience in this filed. While we are told to finish school and get a job and save the longevity and growth of our wealth is not expressed. With this game/program students can have some idea of how the financial and trading system works and will have established ways of controlling and planning out their finances which is an integral part of growing up.</p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The game is to represent a microcosm of the financial system to teens in high school. The schools which openly participate in the game will download the game program given to them by the developers. Students will be given a set amount of fictional money to begin their journey where simulated markets and businesses will be then traded where students can learn how their decisions make an impact on their overall financial status. From the trading students will have to establish some sort of financial planning to maximise their wealth. The effort of students will be encouraged by the incorporation of a ranking system with classmates and other schools, with awards and certificates given out to the schools and students who perform the best. Overall, the game is to encourage financial planning and management, as well as a near identical trading simulation to understand how to make sales of stocks from companies and reading company analytics.  </p>
					<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
					<p>To develop this game/program the software needed does not have to be incredibly demanding but should be built with an established and renowned game engine, for this reason the 2D gaming experience would be created using ‘Unity’. The hardware needed to support this game will not be very demanding and most school supplied laptops and desktops with i3 processors and above, 4gb of ram and more, and a GPU will run this program.</p>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>To create this game the skills that will be required are stem from the software side of the program and not so much the hardware as this will be easy to upload to any device as it will require a download and administration rights to instal. The software skills required will be experience with scripting animations, textures, and interfaces and will also require a strong knowledge of c programming (programming language). The work requirements for this program being an intermediate level should be easy to find with the right advertisement. </p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If the project were deemed a success from the schools, students and teachers who have participated in it then this would see a national roll out for the program to schools with state to country wide competitions held. But more importantly success would mean the sense of clarity high school students and young adults have when dealing with there finances is much easier and that they understand the process and importance of investing their own capital as much as spending is fun. In future this could mean overall wealth is greatly increased for newer generations and financial hardships are few and far between. </p>
