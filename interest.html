					<h1>Interest in Infomation Technology</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT can be attributed to my desire to understand concepts and ideas I believe will have strong implications in future life and societies. In high school participating in Information Technology classes I had really enjoyed the hands-on learning in programming and understanding the concepts and ideas of the class. However, there where also key figures in my life whose advice and interest sparked my own; a friend from high school Steven, opened my eyes to the broad spectrum that is IT and his knowledge of the subject at such a young age gravitated me towards it. Secondly my parents encouraging me to look into IT growing up as it is such new technology in their eyes persuaded me to have an interest also.</p>

<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>I had chosen to come to RMIT university as when I was in high school assessing the preferences for courses for what I intended to do in future and pathways I wanted to follow. RMIT had economics and finance which in captured the overall spectrum of areas which I wanted to follow. As well was the ideal course which I wanted to follow RMIT also offered great facilities in the business school and I was receiving great feed back from past/ current students. The location of the school also played a factor in my preferences as I live in Melbourne’s north and have easy means of traveling to university with trams and trains all a five-minute walk away.</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>During my ‘Information Technology’ studies at RMIT I hope to learn and expand upon the knowledge I already have of the subject. To develop a key insight into the overall landscape of IT and the prospects also. It the course of ‘Economics and Finance’ to expect to learn knowledge of financial markets and the operation of the economy as well as the international scope of the economic operations of countries.</p>
